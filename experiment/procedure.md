### Procedure

a) Circuit formulation:
<br>

1. Connect the circuit to form a 3-phase uncontrolled full-bridge rectifier.

2. Click on “CHECK” button to verify the circuit.

3. a). If all connections are correct then click on “NEXT” button and proceed for experimentation.<br>
   b). If connections are wrong. Press the “RESET” button and reconnect the terminals to create correct circuit.

b) Operating the circuit: 
<br>

1. Operate the circuit by clicking “NEXT MODE” and see the waveforms.<br>

c) Performance analysis of the circuit:
 <br>

1. Select the load out of the options given.

2. Change the source voltage and click on “RECORD” button to fill the table.

3. Click on respective “ICONS” to see the various plots for performance analysis.
